# 100 Days of Swift

Projects from the Hacking with Swift book by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws))

The book is divided into `Projects` and `Milestones`. `Projects` are meant to teach iOS cocepts, techniques and frameworks.  
Every `3` projects, a milestone is reached. `Milestones` are challenges that use the concepts learned in the previous 3 projects. For example, after `Project 3` comes `Milestone 1`.
